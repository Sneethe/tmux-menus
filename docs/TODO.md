# Plan

## WhipTail

- menu_reload is not working, so disabled

## external_tools/dropbox.sh

toggle not working

## Pane titles

Add items, enable/disable show pane titles

## Show defaults

See if instead of just displaying defaults as (x) , displaying current
binding as [x] is possible

Seems hard to implement, left as a long term goal
